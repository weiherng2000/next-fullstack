## How next js works
src files contain our main files
app folder contains our different pages
e.g About folder contains the link to the about page
e.g Blog folder contains link to blog page
blog page has another folder [id] which can be any value that will lead to the blogpost page
for (auth) folder as it is a group name it wont affect the routing
Layout jsx applys to all pages
For navbar and footer we use navbar.jsx and footer.jsx as they are components so 
we do not use page.jsx
